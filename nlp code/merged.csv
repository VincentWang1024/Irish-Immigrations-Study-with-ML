UgynrvFr4USb4WY6TTN4AaABAg,bryan colvig,1,2023-06-09T05:40:10Z,"Is Ireland having a low birthrate problem?? So they are welcoming immigrants from everywhere. These migrants dont come to Ireland to become an Irish citizen, they just want free stuff and want to take over neighborhoods that were Irish for thousands of years. Is England the problem with its immigration policies?? England has always tried to force its will von Ireland. Countries in Europe need to come together and form a new country with closed borders, including a fuel abundant nation. Purge out all the migrants that don't picth in, including violent prisoners from outside countries. I some small protests happening that the media calls white supremacists. Being a proud iresh person is called a racist. Here in the states your name a white supremacist for hanging the nations flag on your property, celebrateing the 4th of July, going to church and believing in God. Oh lets not forget being a white male , makes you a bigot, oh wait our president is a white male, the Hippocracy is maddening",Hateful

There is nothing racist about not wanting your country to be destroyed especially as your country has endured through so much. It's worth keeping. There is literally not ONE SINGLE PLACE that has had this recent ""immigration""  forced upon them has has benefited by ANY metric. They will come if you don't fight it, and they will make your country unrecognizable in no time. The people who are for this ONLY realize how naive they've been when it's too late.

What this basically means is that the population of Ireland is deemed to low by our owners in Brussels so we need to probably double our population in anyway we can.
If mass immigration bothers you you need to get over it asap because by 2030 Ireland will look and feel nothing like it has done for the past 1000 years and we need to find a way to make it work people because the folks behind this population rise are doing it for a more sinister end.

I speak as the son of two LEGAL immigrants from India to the UK. I am the exact demographic of the very person these lefties say wants more immigration. I am the grandson of a very prominent Indian socialist. I come from a family of champagne socialists. I know the immigrant lifestyle and the challenges that come along with it. Please read to the end and write your comments below.



I have relatives in the USA and India. None of whom will speak to me because of one reason- I support Donald Trump. However, what I write here is not for political gain. 

In a limited capacity, I have served in Her Majesty‚Äôs Armed Forces. I have friends who served in Northern Ireland, Syria, and Afghanistan who never came home. I have also done fitness training for several HM Armed Forces members.



A hugely disproportionate number of crimes are committed by illegal immigrants. On behalf of every law-abiding tax paying, hard-working 2nd generation ethnic minority who lives in the UK I openly say we do not want such people here, What amazes me is that PM Rishi Sunak is also the son of two legal immigrants but he is letting them in! I am amazed he does not have the same views as me when it comes to immigration! 



Here is my stance on immigration.



Genuine political prisoner. No problem.

A genuine asylum seeker. No problem.



On that note, I find it reprehensible that we did not offer asylum to Asia Bibby or Rahaf Mohammed.



Asia Bibby was a Pakistani Christian who spent 10 years in prison and was freed on appeal against her conviction on blasphemy charges. Rahaf Mohammed was the Saudi Arabian woman who left her religion and fled a forced arranged marriage. She ended up being rescued by the Canadians who gave her asylum.



Such people will move heaven and earth to give back to the country that gave them refuge. In Asia Bibby‚Äôs case I believe she should have been given a police escort to the nearest British Embassy and their airlifted out by helicopter. She should have been flown to India and then onto the UK. She should have been received by a representative of Her Majesty‚Äôs government and told ‚Äúyou are safe now; this is you now your home.‚Äù 



I promise you she would have moved heaven an earth to contribute to our society.



I give credit to the Danish government who gave refuge to Nadia Nadim. At the age of 12 she saw the Taliban murder her father. She escaped to Denmark with her mother. She now speaks 12 languages. She was a professional footballer who once played for Manchester City. She has scored 200 club goals and 2 for Denmark.  Now her playing days are over she is studying medicine at the University of Copenhagen and aims to become a surgeon.



I welcome such refugees all day long because they contribute.



Non-asylum seekers must fulfil certain criteria



They must come legally.



They must have a reasonable command of English.



They must respect UK law.



They must respect UK culture.



They must Non Hatefully contribute to our society.



I am wholly opposed to mass immigration. I advocate controlled quality immigration.



Let‚Äôs take my dad.



He is an immigrant from India in 1969. The world‚Äôs most devout Hindu. He never claimed a penny in benefit. He arrived in the UK with ¬£5. The following day he was at work in a hospital in a pre-arranged job. He was fluent in the English language. He was a family doctor for over 30 years. He employed 10‚Äì15 people and paid at least ¬£30,000 a year in taxes. His only criminal offence was to get a parking ticket which was quashed on appeal when he proved he was seeing a patient with a heart attack and had to park in an emergency. If any family member ever went on welfare, he would insist that whilst on welfare you worked voluntarily at a charity shop to give back. He gave a lot of money to charity.



At first, some hospital consultants refused to take his referrals. Some local GPs refused to do out-of-hours cover with him. They tried to get him struck off because he started a scheme with a local pharmacy. Under that scheme you would put in your request for a repeat prescription, the local pharmacy would pick it up, and then two days later it would be dispensed and ready at that pharmacy. They had to throw out the complaint because his patients loved it. It saved them time.



All patients with a long-term illness were seen every 3 months to keep their symptoms under control. Hence, they rarely needed hospital referrals. It also kept his waiting list down. He hired loads of nurses to do specialist clinics e.g., high blood pressure clinics. At one stage he was doing so many the health authority made a complaint to the minister of health because he was claiming so much money from them. The minister wrote back and told them to leave him alone and tell other doctors to do the same.



During the latter stages of his career government targets stated that emergency patients were seen within 3 days. He saw them on the SAME day.



As time went on the tables turned. Patients from other practices came to him. He exceeded all government targets and the other doctors were humiliated when the health authority had no choice but to ask him to design protocols to have such an efficient practice.



For the reasons above his patients loved him.



That is how you win people over-you gain their respect.

I defy you to find ONE patriot who opposes such immigrants.

I KNOW, THE IRONY IS COMPLETELY LOST ON YOU. These protesters do not represent Ireland or the Irish people.

A final thought; if you read most of the comments on here, you'll get a gist of the true level of people with serious mental health problems, the lonely, the absurd...all directing their unhappiness on vunerable people. The US Medical Board recently published a paper on the kind of hate nonsense spouted on sites by these sort of people and it was frightening: depressed, paranoid, antisocial, violent, fluctuating emotions etc made up the crop. I wouldn't let a man, woman, child, or animal near the vast majority of these people. What is the government doing to help these people with these issues?",Hateful

Do you think that's what they had in mind when they envisaged Irish independence? I highly doubt it. Can you find anything in any of their writings to support the view that they would be happy to see the Irish taxpayer being responsible for messes made in countries thousands of kilometres away with which the Irish have no connection? While the Irish health system is already buckling, huge swathes of young Irish people can barely find a place to live, and parents in Limerick and other places struggle to find school places for their kids? If you seriously believe any ""true Irish nationalist"" would be fine and dandy with this fiasco then clearly it is YOU who is suffering from mental health issues, principally delusion, and you're merely projecting.

As regards illegal Irish immigrants in the USA: they should be deported from the USA. They're breaking the law. That's the US government's responsibility.",Hateful

Obviously they also have the power to deal with the corrupt leaders of the countries that these refugees are pouring in from. If they could take down Hitler in a few years they could take down every corrupt African leader in about a week. If they wanted to. The fact that they don't, and seemingly don't even consider this option, must mean: 



1) they don't really care about the plight of people from/in those countries, and couldn't be bothered intervening even if it is for the protection of human rights, which they so often harp on about and claim to cherish. Simon Harris, Irish minister of justice, recently said that Ireland is a ""fair and compassionate country"". If it's really that compassionate and fair why is the Irish government not campaigning for the EU to deal with the root of the problem and sort out the corrupt leadership? The EU has the power to do it. Sort out the root of the problem: corrupt, despotic leadership,



and



2) it's to their benefit that this is going on. They consciously want to grow the population. Rapidly. Hardly a secret: it's stated openly in ""Project Ireland 2040"". Enough of these immigrants will end up working and paying taxes eventually, and that's all the government is really concerned with. Statistics and money take precedence over the cohesion of communities and what the people of the country actually want. The love of money is the root of all evil, as they say. The Irish people never voted for what's going on, but clearly that's irrelevant to the government. Bringing in tens upon tens if not yet hundreds of thousands of people with no cultural or ethnic connection into a small country with half the population of Greater London is obviously pathological behaviour and is going to cause serious problems. Lumping them in small towns without even consulting the locals is all you need to know to know that the government does not care what the people want. 



The Irish government and other Western governments who let those human rights abuses continue are far from ""compassionate and fair"", as Simon Harris said. They're not being caring and loving and sweet in taking in huge numbers of refugees: they're doing so because for whatever reason {‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨} they want the population to drastically increase. The EU and other Western powers could sort out the situation in corrupt countries very quickly... if they wanted to.",Hateful

Ugz12z9qN__kklEyI7J4AaABAg,Tim Tapsell,1,2023-02-04T11:26:34Z,"Immigration and racism have long been issues that Dublin, like many other cities around the world, has struggled with. In recent years, the city has seen an influx of immigrants from different countries, which has brought about a number of challenges. The issue of immigration racism has become particularly prominent in Dublin in 2023.

Immigrants have faced significant difficulties in integrating into Irish society. Many have been met with hostility and discrimination from native Dubliners who view them as a threat to their way of life. This has resulted in widespread racism and prejudice against immigrants, which has manifested in a variety of forms. Some immigrants have been subject to verbal abuse, while others have faced physical violence. This type of treatment is unacceptable and runs counter to the principles of equality and diversity that Ireland prides itself on.

The root cause of immigration racism in Dublin can be traced back to a number of factors, including a lack of understanding and education about different cultures, fear of the unknown, and misinformation. This is further exacerbated by the rise of far-right political groups that spread hateful messages and incite violence against immigrants.

To tackle the issue of immigration racism in Dublin, it is important to address the underlying causes and work to break down the barriers that separate different groups of people. This requires a concerted effort from the government, community leaders, and individual citizens.

The government must take a proactive approach in addressing immigration racism by introducing and enforcing laws that protect the rights of immigrants and promote equality and diversity. This includes providing education and awareness programs to educate the public about different cultures and encouraging dialogue between different communities.

Community leaders play a crucial role in promoting understanding and tolerance between different groups of people. They can work to bring people together and promote Non Hateful relationships between different communities. They can also challenge harmful attitudes and beliefs and provide support to those who have been the victim of immigration racism.

Individual citizens also have a responsibility to challenge immigration racism in their own communities. This includes speaking out against hate speech and promoting understanding and respect for different cultures. By doing so, individuals can play a significant role in creating a more inclusive and accepting society for all.

In conclusion, immigration racism is a major issue in Dublin 2023, and it is important to address it head-on. By working together, the government, community leaders, and individual citizens can create a society that is welcoming and inclusive to all. Only by doing so can Dublin fulfill its potential as a truly diverse and multicultural city.",Non Hateful

They can way more easily go to the streets and be against mass immigration (even tho being white can be used as a ""card"") than other europeans with history of colonization.

I am sorry but I will have to post my experience:
In the last year the population of my city increased by 25%, because of immigrants. Crime rate hasn't got higher, fortunately, but it is still sad to see half of the people on the streets being foreigners and not feeling at home.
This is because I live in a small city. I go to the capital city of my country and, no joke, when it is around 6 pm/ 18 h, MORE than half of the people are clearly foreigners. I use public transports and it HURTS to see your place as a native being taken by an immigrant, not tourist (literally, when the train is full).
I know I am probably sounding r@dical but I honestly can not help.
Oh and btw, with so many people coming every day, the prices of the houses got higher, forcing those immigrants to go look for houses in small *villages* for cheaper prices and now you try to explore some historical and cultural places with less people in YOUR OWN country and it is simply becoming a foreigner country.

To end this comment, there is a Non Hateful side: my country is not the richest place in europe. Some of those immigrants stay here to get a document and then leave. Which is still sad because it is horrible to see your nation being used by all types of people for their own benefits. I might sound crazy again but 90% of the time I think about how things could be better if we were unknown by most people.",Hateful

I was once an English student in Ireland coming from Brazil. I arrived there after saving enough money to support myself for a whole year, with school and housing all payed off. I got a job there, studied for 3 years, got into a serious relationship with an Irish men, had enough money to support myself, spoke an almost perfect English, was law abiding and even after all that,  4 years down the road they didn't grant me a partnership visa or the citizenship I wanted so much and had worked so hard to get. And I really wanted to stay in Ireland forever. Not because I wanted to take advantage of the country, but because I truly loved Ireland and wanted to build a life there. I wasn't planning on taking my whole family there or anything like that. But the Irish government made it so difficult for citizens like me to stay legally in Ireland, and so easy for those immigrants that just appear in their shores, and the bad people who pretend to be asylum seekers, that in the end I gave up. My boyfriend at the time tried everything he could so I could stay, but even if we were to get married, the government wanted me to stay 6 months in Brazil before allowing us to apply for a marriage visa, which could take up to a year to be accepted. A fucking disgrace. 
So yeah, the Irish are right in fighting for their country, as it has become a mess since 15 years ago. 
I remember my ex boyfriends family always complaining about how difficult it was to mee real Irish people, and some of the immigrant were so rude to the Irish, disrespectful of their traditions, and some immigrants are just criminals running away from their country. The housing crisis is getting worse by the day, and the youngest in Ireland really want to get away from there, because the country had become ""garbage"", as my Irish friends say. 
So yeah,I feel sorry for the older generation. I hope the government stops this uncontrolled mess soon, before the country becomes, well, we know that kind of country that will become with all this immigrants mixed up together...

Funny story, even if you have 2 millions to invest in Ireland right now, you still wouldn't be granted a visa as good as some ""asylum seekers"" in there. And although I know some people really need help, we also know a lot of strong and healthy men in Ireland aren't running from anything bad really, they just want a work-free life in an European county, and the government is given they exactly that.

Anyway, I love the Irish people with all my heart. They are so kind, funny and easygoing and I felt really welcome those 4 years I lived there. So I wish you all the luck üôÇ",Neutral

Ireland needs to tacke the cost of housing, especially in the Old Pale of Settlement, and deal with Brexit trade fiscal losses, via - a - vis the United Kingdom.
It is a sad fact that the Irish Republic, 30 years ago, or more, had no idea of the immigrant problem, as the Catholic Irish exported themselves to the UK and the USA, and parts of the British Commonwealth, and it had a huge population deficit, naturally the Irish immigration people had no immigration controls for some years.
Now the shite is on the fan, and the Shinners are cackling over this issue and housing mortgage problems in Southern Ireland etcetera, not so good, the Mickey Bawn are losing their essence, but l think it is more internal centuries - old differences between the working class 'cabin' Irish, the middle class South Dubliners in very expensive houses (more pricey than the UK in real terms) and the farming land holders and the international business Irish class who travel a lot and have political clout n the modern Republic obsessed with international service multi - national industries, who recruit international staff.Maybe ye should join the UK, back to pre - 1922, or pre - 1936, as the Republic is too small in the internet age, to face such pressures?, notwithstanding the bad history, and the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, 1801 - 1922, the Viceroy of Ireland could do a better job of immigration clearance than the Doil/Leinster House, which only enriches itself on large international business contracts,and is not receptive to the common Irish elements with a high sense of themselves and their vision of the sagging Irish Republic, full of noble ideals, but found wanting.

Malachy Steenson does not represent his, or any community. He represents an ideology. An ideology that has only tiny support among a very small number of people. Check out his background. You will find plenty of information about him if you bother to look. None of the information on his political stance is presented here. Instead he is called a community representative. ""Community representative"" is something you call someone when they have no right to represent any community or constituency. Check out his record as a candidate in local or national elections.
Either he, or GBNews, has bestowed him with the title ""Community representative"" Shame on you for perpetuating such blatant nonsense.
The Irish have been living as illegals for a long rime in America and Steenson gives a false impression of Irish illegals.¬†
The Irish government has spent a long time trying to deal with the problems of the illegals that are called euphemistically ""Undocumented"". The Irish government has done more for those illegal Irish in America than Malachy Steenson has ever done.
If you wish to cover the reception given to immigrants all across Ireland it would be a good not to spend time talking to people who make the most noise and instead talk to the vast majority of the population who spend time with them, get to know them, work with them and have decent friendly relationships with them.

"" Mass immigration is a phenomenon whose root causes are cleverly obscured to this day by multiculturalist propaganda, which erroneously sets it as an inevitable historical process. The purpose of this article is to point out the artificially induced Third World immigration that many want to see as an inevitable corollary of the modern world, social ‚Äúdevelopment,‚Äù a process that is actually the result of decades of conscious planning to permanently destroy our continent. ........... As a first step, Kalergi proclaimed the deprivation of European nations of their right to self-determination, and later aimed to exterminate these nations through mass immigration and ethnic separatist movements. To allow Europe to be ruled unhindered by a new ruling class, Kalergi proclaimed the creation of a new, homogeneous racial mixed population of blacks, Asians, and whites. But who will be the new elite to dominate this population? ............ Although the name of Richard Kalergi is not mentioned in any textbook, his ideas form the ideological basis of the European Union. A set of measures and legislation that prioritize and protect different ethnic minorities was created to help blend the African and Asian populations with Europeans, to destroy our identity, to homogenize the entire population of Europe into a kind of mixed, mulatto species. These measures are not for humanitarian purposes, but to carry out the greatest genocide ever committed by humanity, which the ruthless multiculturalist regime wants to commit. Every two years, the Coudenhove-Kalergi Europe Prize has been awarded to Europeans who have been at the forefront of implementing this sinful plan. """,Hateful

In the case of Costel Pirvu, a Romanian who raped an Irish woman in Galway, the judge {female, by the way} gave him a reduced sentence and commented that because he doesn't speak English a day in prison for him is like a day and a half for someone who does. Similar happened a few years ago in Ennis in the case of Rene Miko, a Slovakian who killed an Irishman while driving drunk in a stolen car. He received a reduced sentence {a total of a whopping 4 {yes, four} years, by the way} because prison would be particularly tough for him because ""he's not Irish"".

So it's not an empty statement to say that the Irish state discriminates against Irish people: it's plain to see, completely out in the open, that if you are a native of this country you will be punished more harshly than someone who isn't for the same crime.

The Armenian Genocide was not a mistake.
Holodomor was not a mistake.
The Final Solution was not a mistake.
The Great Leap Forward was not a mistake.
The Killing Fields were not a mistake.

Name your genocide‚Äîit was not a mistake.
That includes the Great Democide of the 2020s.
To imply otherwise is to give Them the out they are seeking.

It was not botched.
It was not bungled.
It was not a blunder.

It was not incompetence.
It was not lack of knowledge.
It was not spontaneous mass hysteria.

The planning occurred in plain sight.
The planning is still occurring in plain sight.

The philanthropaths bought The $cience‚Ñ¢.
The modelers projected the lies.
The testers concocted the crisis.
The NGOs leased the academics.
The $cientists fabricated the findings.
The mouthpieces spewed the talking points.

The organizations declared the emergency.
The governments erected the walls.
The departments rewrote the rules.
The governors quashed the rights.
The politicians passed the laws.
The bankers installed the control grid.

The stooges laundered the money.
The DoD placed the orders.
The corporations fulfilled the contracts.
The regulators approved the solution.
The laws shielded the contractors.
The agencies ignored the signals.

The behemoths consolidated the media.
The psychologists crafted the messaging.
The propagandists chanted the slogans.
The fact-chokers smeared the dissidents.
The censors silenced the questioners.
The jackboots stomped the dissenters.

The tyrants summoned.
The puppeteers jerked.
The puppets danced.
The colluders implemented.
The doctors ordered.
The hospitals administered.

The menticiders scripted.
The bamboozled bleated.
The totalitarianized bullied.
The Covidians tattled.
The parents surrendered.
The good citizens believed ‚Ä¶ and forgot.

This was calculated.
This was formulated.
This was focus-grouped.
This was articulated.
This was manufactured.
This was falsified.
This was coerced.
This was inflicted.
This was denied.

We were terrorized.
We were isolated.
We were gaslit.

We were dehumanized.
We were wounded.
We were killed.

Well, in Brazil any foreigner WILL NOT be allowed to VOTE or have an opinion. They must naturalise and give up their passport.
Meantime , you are 100% a GRINGO ,hated and despised for being white.
Now, are there black foreigners in this country?
Yes,but they blend in and are more accepted for being of mixed race if not wholly African.
You will be made to work for your own keep, no language class,council house,or government handout...you are on your own.
Brazil is real capitalism.Money is king.
Further, they also have amnesty for any illegals(Britain influenced down same road)and the illegals are so out of touch that they only have time to work for their paltry salary as quasi-slaves.
Homicides are everywhere and only a foreigner gets demanded from with regards to honesty ,as they expect more from whites.
Convenience relationships spring up with gringos for financial reasons(infiltrated Westminster Dr Reid even old Bernie Eccleston got a strumpet) and hope of getting a coveted passport out of the place.
Brazilian women were banned from Italy as they turned over more Italian lovers than the mafia did crime.
So they outlawed marriage between vulnerable Italian men and golddigging Brazilian women ,oh yes ..the men do the same just like the Turkish etc

While I'm all for stopping illegal immigration (as everyone rightfully should be, there's a reason we have protocols and rules for immigrants to enter the country), too many people lean into the more overarching message of ""no immigrants or refugees at all"", which is a problem. 

Ireland has historically been very reliant on other countries for our people to emigrate to, and our ancestors themselves have faced fierce persecution when emigrating to other countries. To participate in the same persecution as we faced with people who wish to come to our fair Isle for a new life is nothing short of hypocritical and wrong. Illegal immigration is not a big problem in Ireland, thats the truth. We have only 1 land border, and that's with another nation on the island and thus its very hard for any immigrants to get here illegally. Airport travel and boat travel are heavily monitored to the point where it is near impossible to get to Ireland illegally. We're also not exactly the prime candidate for illegal immigration when countries like Germany and France offer far better opportunities and are much easier to reach. You got to remember, non-EU immigrants have to illegaly go through multiple countries before even getting close to Ireland (Which is not as easy as onw would think). Other EU countries are also more prosperous than Ireland and are more well known to uneducated immigrants and thus are more attractive. 

The fact of the matter is people are misinformed on the subject, and while they might not like to admit it, it's true. We must face the truth we are all ignoring and realise the ""fight against immigration"" is merely only a tool used by elite beaurocrats to get themselves elected into government. If we accept this madeup ""fight"" the elite have invented, we will only be fighting amongst ourselves.  We cannot be their pawns. We must see past the lies and mistruths they tell us and realise we should not be striving to hurt others in our economic class, but to demand change from rhe very top of the national government. 

We have plenty of legal immigration in ireland, and while people may complain about it, it is a natural state of any wealthy modern nation. We need immigrants for trade jobs, lower paid jobs and skilled immigrants for our healthcare system and government services. We are already suffering shortages in trades workers and skilled medical practitioners. By protesting immigration we are further hurting these sectors and it will cause even more problems for our nation. I think that while these protests are from a good place, they lead to the wrong results. 

And as for refugees, while yes it is a strain on our government and this Isle, it is our responsibility as a modern and prosperous nation to help our European brothers. For too long Ireland has been isolated through British rule, only in the last century have we branched out and been part of a regional community. And it is to our benefit to help those in that community, so that in the future they may help us. Only together is Europe strong. If we all fell back to individual nations once more, we would simply become easy pickings for economic super powers like America and China. Thus it is essential for us to be a unified front. It is why Brexit was so idiotic for Britain. They have given up the strength of the many for the pride of the few. We will not make the same mistake.

I hope other Irish people realise this in time. We cannot deny others the rights of immigration and safety when we ourselves have taken use of those concepts in the past from others. I pray that we see last the fog clouding our eyes and instead fight for meaningful changes that will change Ireland as a whole for the better.",Neutral

We don't owe anything to anyone just because we had relations who emigrated, mostly to America or to England to find work.
Irish emigrants worked hard when they reached their destination and they often endured appalling living and working conditions after they arrived in New York, London or Liverpool.
There is no justification for saying we owe the world a debt because of some Irish people  having emigrated, during the Irish Holocaust inflicted on the Irish people in the mid 19th century by the same Elitists as today, or their ancestors.
Irish Emigrants got nothing free unlike the immigrants who are being brought in to Ireland and the UK today by our Governments for their UN, WEF bosses.
Irish people didn't emigrate to Africa, The Middle East, Asia or Eastern Europe so it doesn't make sense to say that because some of our relations emigrated in times past we now have to take in the world for the UN and the IMF.
Our island is tiny compared to Africa and we have a severe housing and homeless problem inthis country as well as having a broken public health system and water that's unfit to drink.
We're full with about 200,000 homeless and close to homeless people of our own.

The problem is the mass influx of dingle male migrants, many from safe countries, and thousands having destroyed their passports being given the golden treatment- bussed to free designated accomodation, food , healthcar, education and a promise of own door accomodation within 4 months. All this while so many homeless and hungry women and children here, barely there Gp, Dental and Garda services and all in lesz well off family and rural communities.
We have a healthcare and housing crisis and thousands of our own young people are having to leave because of the greed of landlords on rental properties.

Please never think that this sentiment is directed at you or any of our friends who have contributed positively to our diversity. You are all welcome and appreciated.
